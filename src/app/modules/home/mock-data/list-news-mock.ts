                a supermarket in the city of Buffalo.</p>
                <p>He began firing in the store's car park before entering and continuing his rampage, streaming the 
                attack online.</p>
                <p>US President Joe Biden condemned what he described as an "abhorrent" act.</p>
                <p>"We are investigating this incident as both a hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent 
                extremism," said Stephen Belongia, from the FBI's Buffalo office, adding there was evidence of "racial 
                animosity."</p>
                <p>CBS news reported that the attacker shouted racial slurs during the shooting and suggested that he had 
                a racial slur written on his weapon. He also apparently posted a manifesto online which included racist 
                language and ideas.</p>`,

                two-and-a-half years, North Korea has stuck to its claim it has seen no cases of

            content: `<p></p>
                <p>This week, the country confirmed its first infections. The highly reclusive 
                nation had responded to the pandemic by closing its borders, although few believed 
                it had really managed to escape the virus.</p>
                <p>Now, the authorities are not only acknowledging the virus' presence but declaring 
                an all-out battle to control it, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un calling it the 
                "greatest turmoil" to fall on the nation since its founding. A national lockdown is 
                in place.</p>
                <p>Hardly anywhere in the world is untouched by Covid. Cases have been recorded at 
                the base camp of Everest and in Antarctica. Individual nations' responses to the 
                pandemic have varied in severity, but have broadly meant vaccine programmes, 
                testing, social distancing and limits on travel.</p>
                <p>How the pandemic in North Korea will unfold is likely to remain murky, given the 
                nation's secrecy.</p>
                <p>There are fears Covid could be disastrous there. "I'm really concerned about how 
                many people are going to die," said one of the experts who spoke to the BBC.</p>`,

                description: `In 1518, a 'dance plague' saw citizens of French city Strasbourg 
                        reportedly dancing uncontrollably for days on end – with fatal results. It's a 
                        bizarre event that continues to fascinate artists and writers, writes Rosalind 
                        Jana.`,
                content: `<p>Like all good plague stories, this one begins with omens. A star streaks 
                        across the sky. Fields flood. Extreme cold is followed by extreme heat, which is followed, 
                        inevitably, by extreme hunger. On a sweltering summer's day in July 1518 a woman 
                        called Frau Troffea steps into a square in Strasbourg and begins to dance. At first 
                        those around her only watch, curiosity piqued by this unusual public display. They watch 
                        a woman who will not, cannot, stop. She dances for nearly a week, felled occasionally by 
                        exhaustion but largely undaunted by the body's other warning signs: pain, hunger, shame. 
                        There is no music. Her heart keeps the tempo, working hard to make the motion continue.</p>
                        <p>By the time she is taken away, it is too late. Others have joined. By August there will 
                        be hundreds. Like her, they cannot explain themselves. They dance as if compelled, feet 
                        bloodied and limbs twitching. A poem taken from a contemporary chronicle describes "women 
                        and men who dance and hop…/ In the public market, in alleys and streets,/ Day and night" 
                        until the "sickness" finally stops. Further chronicles outline the measures taken by the 
                        authorities in response. </p>
                        <p>One writer describes dancers being carted off to St Vitus's shrine outside the city, 
                        where they are "given small crosses and red shoes". Another mentions more direct arrangements 
                        made for the dancers to tire them into submission, with "persons… specially appointed to 
                        dance with them for payment, to the music of drums and pipes". This does not help. "All 
                        this was of no avail, and many danced themselves to death."</p>`,

                        the miner's credo. The extraction of minerals, metals and 
                        fuels from the ground is one of humankind's oldest 
                        industries. And our appetite for it is growing.</p>
                        <p>Society is more dependent on both greater variety and 
                        larger volumes of mined substances than ever before. If 
                        you live in a middle-income country, every year you use 
                        roughly 17 tonnes of raw materials – equivalent to the 
                        weight of three elephants and twice as much as 20 years 
                        ago. For a person in a high-income country, it is 26 
                        tonnes – or four and a half elephants' worth.</p>
                        <p>Extracting new materials continues to be cheaper 
                        than re-use for many substances, leading some experts

                        biodiversity loss, as well as the social impacts caused 
                        to local communities, could sometimes outweigh the benefits 
                        of mining.</p>

                        of the carbon it took to report and publish that article. 
                        How do we get that figure and why do we calculate it?`,
                content: `<p>Like almost every human activity in the world, 
                        journalism releases carbon dioxide. Reporters often need 
                        to travel to reach a story, whether across a city or further 
                        afield. They need to switch on the lights, power up laptops 
                        and make phone calls. As in other industries, journalism’s 
                        carbon impact will lessen over time as (and if) more of the world’s 
                        power grids and transit systems are powered by sustainable energy. 
                        But for now, this is the reality we face.</p>
                        <p>Because Future Planet is our new section devoted to covering 
                        the climate crisis, pollution and the environment, we felt it was 
                        important for it, as much as possible, to be part of the solution. 
                        As a result, we wanted to minimise our carbon footprint.</p>
                        <p>We do this, first, by keeping journalists’ travel to a minimum 
                        and prioritising local voices.</p>
                        <p>But that doesn’t eliminate our carbon emissions from transport 
                        entirely. Sometimes local or regional travel is essential when 
                        there is no lower-carbon way to tell the story. And, in what may 
                        come as a surprise to some, digital publishing releases carbon 
                        emissions too: as a whole, the internet would be the sixth greatest 
                        emitter of greenhouse gases if it were a country.</p>`,
