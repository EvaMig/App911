                an ambulance using a mobile phone.`,
        content: `<p>An injury can be received anywhere, and if there is a threat to life and health, emergency 
                medical care is required. Each of us has the right to call an ambulance at any point in your 
                country.</p>
                <p>According to the general standard established by the government of the Republic of Belarus, 
                the “03” service team must arrive no later than 20 minutes after the call is received by the 
                dispatcher.</p>
                <p>A1, MTS and life subscribers have two options.</p>
                <p>The first one is dialing 103. So you will immediately get to the ambulance station of the 
                settlement where you ended up. Dictate the exact address of the place of emergency and briefly 
                describe the situation.</p>
                <p>In addition, there is a single duty dispatch service in Belarus. It is enough to contact 
                them at 112 and describe the nature of the emergency - your call will be immediately forwarded 
                to the appropriate emergency (101, 102, 103, 104) response service.</p>
                <p>In both cases, the call is free of charge.</p>

        description: `Bleeding is the flow of blood from blood vessels into or out of
                organs, tissues, natural cavities of the body. Here you will learn what 
                first aid should be provided to avoid serious health consequences, 
                including death.`,
        content: `<p>With the development of severe bleeding from large vessels, a person needs to be given 
                medical attention, since significant blood loss poses a great threat to health and can lead 
                to death</p>
                <p>Damage to the walls of blood vessels that causes bleeding can occur for various reasons:
                        <ul>
                                <li>injuries, wounds, bruises;</li>
                                <li>inflammatory processes (erosion, ulcers) in the wall of blood vessels;</li>
                                <li>thinning of the walls of blood vessels;</li>
                                <li>germination of tumors in the vessels and their subsequent decay;</li>
                                <li>chemical poisoning, burns, frostbite.</li>
                        </ul>
                Bleeding is divided into arterial (from arteries), venous (from veins), capillary 
                (observed with extensive superficial wounds, bleeding occurs from the entire 
                surface of the wound), internal (bleeding into internal organs or cavities).
                </p>
                <p>Arterial bleeding occurs when an artery is damaged. Blood pours out in a scarlet 
                pulsating stream. This is one of the most dangerous types of bleeding, fatal blood 
                loss can develop in a few seconds. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to 
                stop the bleeding immediately.</p>
                <p>What can be done:</p>
                <p>When providing first aid for arterial bleeding, it is necessary:
                        <ul>
                                <li>press the thumb on the artery above the wound to stop or at least ease the bleeding;</li>
                                <li>apply a rubber or any other homemade tourniquet (what will fall under the hands, for 
                                example, a belt, cord, etc.) to the artery above the wound, this will reduce blood loss;</li>
                                <li>leave a note indicating the time the tourniquet was applied;</li>
                                <li>bandage the wound;</li>
                                <li>after rendering assistance to the victim, he should be immediately sent to a specialized 
                                medical institution (hospital or clinic).</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>What Not to Do:
                        <ul>
                                <li>leave the tourniquet longer than an hour. Otherwise, tissue necrosis may occur;</li>
                                <li>remove the blood-soaked bandage. A new one is put on top of it.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Venous bleeding occurs when a vein is damaged. Blood is poured out in a uniform stream of dark color. 
                When a vein is injured near a large artery, intermittent outpouring of blood is possible. With the 
                defeat of large veins, venous bleeding can also be deadly if the necessary measures are not taken 
                in time.</p>
                <p>What can be done:</p>
                <p>When providing first aid for venous bleeding, it is necessary:
                        <ul>
                                <li>raise the injured limb up;</li>
                                <li>apply a tight pressure bandage to the wound;</li>
                                <li>send the victim to a healthcare facility.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>What not to do:
                        <ul>
                                <li>attempt to clean the wound or remove small objects from it, such as broken glass;</li>
                                <li>remove blood clots and blood clots, otherwise bleeding may open.</li>
                        </ul>

                important to remember that without observing the rules for using electrical 
                appliances, an electric shock is possible, first aid is necessary, moreover, 
                without harm to others. Why is electricity dangerous and how does it affect 
                the body?`,
        content: `<p>When someone has been injured by an electric shock, it is important 
                to know what steps to take to help the victim. In addition, you need to 
                be aware of the potential risks associated with helping an electric 
                shock victim and how to help without putting yourself in danger.</p>
                <p>A person can get an electric shock due to faulty household 
                electrical wiring. An electric shock occurs when an electric current 
                passes from a live outlet to a specific part of the body.</p>
                <p>Electrical injury can occur as a result of contact with:
                        <ul>
                                <li>faulty electrical appliances or equipment;</li>
                                <li>household wiring;</li>
                                <li>power lines;</li>
                                <li>lightning strike;</li>
                                <li>electrical outlets.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>There are four main types of electrical contact injury:
                        <ul>
                                <li>flash, short impact: Sudden injury usually causes superficial 
                                burns. They result from the formation of an arc, which is a type 
                                of electrical discharge. The current does not penetrate the skin;</li>
                                <li>ignition: These injuries occur when an electrical discharge 
                                causes a person's clothing to catch fire. The current may or may 
                                not pass through the skin;</li>
                                <li>lightning strike: the injury is associated with a short but 
                                high voltage of electrical energy. Current flows through the human body;</li>
                                <li>closing the circuit: the person becomes part of the circuit and 
                                electricity flows in and out of the body.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The degree of danger of defeat depends on the threshold of "letting go" - the current 
                strength and voltage. The "let go" threshold is the level at which a person's muscles 
                contract. This means that he cannot let go of the source of electricity until someone 
                safely removes it.</p>
                <p>Household electricity in some countries is 110 volts (V), in our country it is 220 
                V, some appliances need 360 V. Industrial and power lines can withstand voltages in 
                excess of 100,000 V. High voltage currents of 500 V or more can cause deep burns, and 
                low voltage currents of 110-120 V can cause muscle spasms.</p>`,
