                <p>According to the general standard established by the government of the Republic of Belarus, 
                the “03” service team must arrive no later than 20 minutes after the call is received by the

                <p>A1, MTS and life subscribers have two options.</p>
                <p>The first one is dialing 103. So you will immediately get to the ambulance station of the

        description: `Bleeding is the flow of blood from blood vessels into or out of
                organs, tissues, natural cavities of the body. Here you will learn what 
                first aid should be provided to avoid serious health consequences, 
                including death.`,
        content: `<p>With the development of severe bleeding from large vessels, a person needs to be given 
                medical attention, since significant blood loss poses a great threat to health and can lead 
                to death</p>
                <p>Damage to the walls of blood vessels that causes bleeding can occur for various reasons:
                        <ul>
                                <li>injuries, wounds, bruises;</li>
                                <li>inflammatory processes (erosion, ulcers) in the wall of blood vessels;</li>

                                <li>germination of tumors in the vessels and their subsequent decay;</li>
                                <li>chemical poisoning, burns, frostbite.</li>
                        </ul>
                Bleeding is divided into arterial (from arteries), venous (from veins), capillary 
                (observed with extensive superficial wounds, bleeding occurs from the entire 
                surface of the wound), internal (bleeding into internal organs or cavities).
                </p>
                <p>Arterial bleeding occurs when an artery is damaged. Blood pours out in a scarlet 
                pulsating stream. This is one of the most dangerous types of bleeding, fatal blood 
                loss can develop in a few seconds. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to 
                stop the bleeding immediately.</p>
                <p>What can be done:</p>
                <p>When providing first aid for arterial bleeding, it is necessary:
                        <ul>
                                <li>press the thumb on the artery above the wound to stop or at least ease the bleeding;</li>
                                <li>apply a rubber or any other homemade tourniquet (what will fall under the hands, for 
                                example, a belt, cord, etc.) to the artery above the wound, this will reduce blood loss;</li>
                                <li>leave a note indicating the time the tourniquet was applied;</li>
                                <li>bandage the wound;</li>
                                <li>after rendering assistance to the victim, he should be immediately sent to a specialized 
                                medical institution (hospital or clinic).</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>What Not to Do:
                        <ul>
                                <li>leave the tourniquet longer than an hour. Otherwise, tissue necrosis may occur;</li>
                                <li>remove the blood-soaked bandage. A new one is put on top of it.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Venous bleeding occurs when a vein is damaged. Blood is poured out in a uniform stream of dark color. 
                When a vein is injured near a large artery, intermittent outpouring of blood is possible. With the 
                defeat of large veins, venous bleeding can also be deadly if the necessary measures are not taken 
                in time.</p>
                <p>What can be done:</p>
                <p>When providing first aid for venous bleeding, it is necessary:
                        <ul>
                                <li>raise the injured limb up;</li>
                                <li>apply a tight pressure bandage to the wound;</li>
                                <li>send the victim to a healthcare facility.</li>

                <p>What not to do:
                        <ul>
                                <li>attempt to clean the wound or remove small objects from it, such as broken glass;</li>
                                <li>remove blood clots and blood clots, otherwise bleeding may open.</li>

                appliances, an electric shock is possible, first aid is necessary, moreover, 
                without harm to others. Why is electricity dangerous and how does it affect 
                the body?`,
        content: `<p>When someone has been injured by an electric shock, it is important 
                to know what steps to take to help the victim. In addition, you need to 
                be aware of the potential risks associated with helping an electric 
                shock victim and how to help without putting yourself in danger.</p>
                <p>A person can get an electric shock due to faulty household 
                electrical wiring. An electric shock occurs when an electric current 
                passes from a live outlet to a specific part of the body.</p>
                <p>Electrical injury can occur as a result of contact with:
                        <ul>
                                <li>faulty electrical appliances or equipment;</li>
                                <li>household wiring;</li>
                                <li>power lines;</li>
                                <li>lightning strike;</li>
                                <li>electrical outlets.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>There are four main types of electrical contact injury:
                        <ul>
                                <li>flash, short impact: Sudden injury usually causes superficial 
                                burns. They result from the formation of an arc, which is a type 
                                of electrical discharge. The current does not penetrate the skin;</li>
                                <li>ignition: These injuries occur when an electrical discharge 
                                causes a person's clothing to catch fire. The current may or may 
                                not pass through the skin;</li>
                                <li>lightning strike: the injury is associated with a short but 
                                high voltage of electrical energy. Current flows through the human body;</li>
                                <li>closing the circuit: the person becomes part of the circuit and 
                                electricity flows in and out of the body.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The degree of danger of defeat depends on the threshold of "letting go" - the current 
                strength and voltage. The "let go" threshold is the level at which a person's muscles 
                contract. This means that he cannot let go of the source of electricity until someone 
                safely removes it.</p>
                <p>Household electricity in some countries is 110 volts (V), in our country it is 220 
                V, some appliances need 360 V. Industrial and power lines can withstand voltages in 
                excess of 100,000 V. High voltage currents of 500 V or more can cause deep burns, and 
                low voltage currents of 110-120 V can cause muscle spasms.</p>`,

        description: `Our life consists of many elements and anxiety is one of them. We as humans feel 
                different kinds of anxiety and sometimes cause serious damage to our overall health. Anxiety 
                is one of the most common mental health problems with symptoms such as nervousness, tension, 
                agitation, etc.`,
        content: `<p>We feel anxious in numerous ways when taking a test, before making an important decision, 
                when someone we care about gets sick and more. In the case of anxiety disorder, the problems are quite 
                serious and need proper therapy or medication. Our aim is to give you tips to better manage anxiety 
                and stress. In this article, we will list the 5 natural treatments for anxiety, remedies that will help 
                you feel calmer.</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>1. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
                                <p>Physical activity can only bring good to your mental health and can really be beneficial against 
                                anxiety. Any exercise, in general, comes with benefits for the brain, because when exercising we increase 
                                a protein in the brain that convinces us that something we initially thought is dangerous really is 
                                not. We recommend at least 3 hours of walking and running a week in nature.</p>
                                <p>But even other types of fitness and exercising work, as long as you get moving. Other outdoor 
                                activities such as rock climbing are very beneficial for many people to reduce anxiety and depression. 
                                Exercising helps us be more confident, trusting ourselves and others, and enjoy the moment. Much scientific 
                                research on the field of anxiety, stress, and depression suggests that physical activity can also help people 
                                with the anxiety of quitting smoking or other addictions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>2. BETTER TIME MANAGEMENT AND MEDITATION
                                <p>One of the most common factors that cause anxiety is bad time management. We may feel very anxious if we 
                                have to take care of a lot of things at once. And this not only involves our own business but also family and 
                                friends or colleagues. Our daily life consists of our work, family, friends, and physical activity or relaxation.</p>
                                <p>So, if we manage to create and keep track of a plan for the things we do daily, it can really help us get rid of 
                                anxiety. Of course, this can not be done in a day, instead, we should have continuity and never quit.</p>
                                <p>Another thing you can do is meditation, as it helps manage stress and anxiety easier. Meditation during yoga can 
                                really help slow racing thoughts and improve mood.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>3. EAT HEALTHIER OR IMPROVE YOUR DIET
                                <p>Improving your diet can bring many benefits to your mental health. Eating fewer sweets can improve anxiety scores 
                                by 30 percent. Healthy eating is really important because what we eat directly impacts the beneficial bacteria in our
                                 microbiome. This results in producing mood-improving chemicals in our brain such as serotonin.</p>
                                <p>We recommend you include chamomile tea in your diet because it can alter levels of stress hormones. Magnesium is 
                                also really important because taking 500 mg of magnesium results in lower anxiety scores. Comfort foods such as spinach 
                                and black beans contain a considerable amount of magnesium, so we suggest making space in your diet for these two as well.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>4. GET MORE SLEEP OR SPEND MORE TIME WITH ANIMALS
                                <p>Anxiety may keep us awake at night, unfortunately. In fact, most of us need something from 7 to 9 hours of sleep nightly, 
                                and we should do our best to get more sleep. Power down your electronics such as your phone, laptop, or TV and do everything 
                                else you can to sleep earlier. Better sleeping experience can really improve mood and relieve anxiety and stress.</p>
                                <p>Another thing that helps is spending time with animals. Pet owners claim that pets offer a lot of love, companionship, 
                                and support, thus helping people who suffer a variety of mental health disorders, including our main topic, anxiety. So, 
                                spending time outdoors or indoors with cats, dogs, and other pets will have many benefits. This kind of remedy can also 
                                help reduce anxiety and stress associated with the effects of trauma.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>5. CBD (CANNABIDIOL)
                                <p>One of the most famous natural remedies to fight anxiety lately is CBD. CBD products such as CBD oil have significant 
                                potential to reduce anxiety and stress. CBD oil is a derivative of hemp, which is a Cannabis Sativa strain, different 
                                from marijuana. Hemp contains a significant amount of CBD and less than 0.3% THC or no THC at all, in order to be legal 
                                by federal law in most countries.</p>
                                <p>CBD oil itself does not contain THC at all, and that is really important. Why? Because THC or tetrahydrocannabinol 
                                can cause addiction and the “high effect”. Since there is no THC on CBD oil, it is readily available without prescription 
                                in healthcare shops or many other types of stores these days. CBD oil can be found in online retailers also at cheaper prices.</p>
                                <p>This cannabinoid has a long list of therapeutic properties and taking it can impressively improve our overall health. 
                                Before going for it though, we suggest you make a visit to your doctor for more information. These days the doctors are 
                                really updated with CBD products and can give you valuable advice on the way you will take CBD and the dosage. We recommend 
                                you start in small doses and increase the percentage until you find the one that fits your age and weight.</p>
                                <p>In conclusion, we can say that untreated anxiety can cause more stress and problems in our daily life. So, using the 
                                natural remedies we wrote above can really help us manage stress and anxiety and change our life for the better. We may 
                                need to try a lot of therapies or remedies before finding the one that works. In the end, we encourage you to follow all 
                                of the above remedies because you can expect only good results from them as they are natural.</p>

                        <li>Why rehabilitation?
                                <p>To go into rehabilitation, the sufferer does not have to have a major or long-term 
                                addiction. When one thinks of the term rehabilitation, it often gets a bad reputation because most assume that one has to have 
                                a significantly dangerous addiction with an illegal drug for many years to be able to be admitted. This is a major myth.</p>
                                <p>In fact, according to statistics from Drug Rehab, almost a fourth of rehabilitation patients received treatment for 
                                alcohol addiction alone while 18 percent suffered from both alcohol and a drug addiction in conjunction. Together are quite 
                                larger than the number of individuals who received treatment for just heroin addiction (14 percent).</p>
                                <p>The truth is, anyone can be admitted into a rehabilitation center who deems – or who others deem – to have a physiological 
                                addition or psychological dependence on any type of drug, legal or not, for any amount of time.</p>
                                <p>However, the first step is always noticing that there is an addiction, and secondly, doing something about it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Rehabilitation treatment for minors
                                <p>Minors can be required to receive rehabilitation treatment, but individuals over age 18 cannot be forced against their will.</p>
                                <p>It’s true that minors can be forced to go to rehab while non-minors can make the decision whether they do or don’t want to 
                                receive professional help. Putting age out of the picture, however, the quicker one receives treatment, the better and more 
                                successful the results may be.</p>
                                <p>While individuals under age 18 can be sent to a rehabilitation center by their parents or guardians, it is said that it is 
                                best for them and for their recovery if they make the decision themselves or at least pick where they wish to get help. 
                                Nevertheless, it all comes down to what would work best for everyone involved in the sufferer’s addiction.</p>
                                <p>As for the second point regarding legal adults not being required to get rehabilitation treatment, they can, however, be forced 
                                to attend under court orders if there is evidence that the sufferer’s addiction is not just a harm to themselves but to others.</p>
                                <p>However, do note that if someone over the age of 18-years-old does agree to admit themselves into a rehabilitation center or 
                                other treatment method without a court order can leave whenever they desire without permission.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Addiction recovery center
                                <p>Not every addiction recovery center will be effective for everyone long term.</p>
                                <p>Let’s face it, every addiction recovery center drastically varies from one to the next. For some, one center may have a plethora 
                                of benefits while another may cause relapse shortly after one is involved in inpatient care. Then there are cases where a 
                                patient does well in a center that someone else may not.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Results of rehabilitation
                                <p>Through rehabilitation, many patients initially get worse before they get better.</p>
                                <p>Everyone wants an easy recovery, but easy is out of the picture. The truth is, recovery 
                                can be as bumpy as a road as the addiction itself is or was. In the beginning, many will 
                                want to give up, but pushing through is truly the best thing one can do for themselves and 
                                their health.</p>
                                <p>For some, recovery itself is a physical and psychological adjustment; the whole idea of 
                                pushing forward and changing is exhausting. It’s also a vulnerable time as they must open 
                                up about and reflect on why they have an addiction and why they wish to end it.</p>
                                <p>Of course, battling the physiological components of addiction in terms of withdrawals 
                                is a battle in itself. However, once the body gets used to its functioning without the 
                                drug and detoxes with time, the patient will feel better in many forms.</p>
                                <p>Another thing that can make addiction recovery worse before it can get better is the 
                                fact that the sufferer is more aware of their progress or lack of. If they see little to 
                                no progression on a personal level, they may be more prone to giving up, thinking that 
                                they cannot entirely heal. But healing from anything is rarely a consistent process.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Lengths of recovery can be different for everybody
                                <p>In point #3, we discussed that rehabilitation centres won’t all be effective for 
                                everyone and that some may be great for some but not meant for others. Similarly, 
                                each individual’s journey will be different in length regardless of where they receive 
                                their help.</p>
                                <p>As an example, someone with a three month-long alcohol addiction may have a more 
                                difficult time recovering and pushing forward than someone with a ten year-long heroin 
                                addiction.</p>
                                <p>There are different reasons why recovery rates can vary so drastically:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                                <li>A major part of addiction depends greatly on one’s current mental 
                                                health, life stressors, and/or emotional stability. In fact, many turn 
                                                to drug usage to begin with to combat problems with themselves or others.</li>
                                                <li>If drug usage is due to a life problem, the individuals whose problem(s) 
                                                is/are newer and unexpected will often have a harder time giving up their addiction.</li>
                                                <li>Someone with a supportive family, group of friends, and/or spouse is more likely 
                                                to recover quicker than someone who is surrounded by non-supportive people or even 
                                                individuals who discourage sobriety.</li>
                                                <li>Everyone has a different level of perseverance. However, this can be built through 
                                                recovery along the way.</li>
                                                <li>The type and amount of drugs used, and the body type of the sufferer, can play 
                                                a role in how quickly one can give up their addiction physically.</li>
                                                <li>Individuals with an addiction who have a clear path and future goals are more 
                                                likely to push towards sobriety quicker than ones who feel that there is no hope 
                                                or reason to get clean.</li>
                                                <li>Some sufferers are not yet aware of the harm their addiction is placing on their 
                                                health and on their job, family and friends, intimate relationships, and the like. 
                                                There are some individuals who have to hit rock bottom first to grasp a reason to 
                                                make a change.</li>
                                                <li>Individuals who are slower to recover may not yet be ready for that type of 
                                                change just yet or are simply more difficult to adjust to change.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                <p>Besides the above points, some individuals are naturally quicker to heal emotionally, 
                                mentally, and physically than others based on their personality. Nothing is nothing wrong 
                                with that. The only thing that matters with any type of struggle is how someone comes out 
                                of it and learns from it after the fact.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Choosing to stay in a sober living home
                                <p>Choosing to stay in a sober living home can ensure a post-rehabilitation patient will 
                                have a more successful treatment.</p>
                                <p>Especially for individuals who are surrounded by friends and family members who 
                                frequently drink alcohol or engage in any other kind of drug usage, it is important 
                                that rehabilitation patients “graduate” to living in a sober living home – although 
                                not required.</p>
                                <p>A sober living home is an environment that can provide short- or long-term 
                                overnight stay for ex or current addiction sufferers that have specific policies 
                                (e.g., no procession or alcohol or other drugs, no weapons, no violence, etc.). 
                                Every home has its own set of rules residents must follow if they wish to live 
                                there.</p>
                                <p>Some homes are stricter than others, but each seeks to provide a safe 
                                environment for those struggling or who have struggled in the past with 
                                drug addiction. One of the benefits of sober living homes is that individuals 
                                get to live with others going through similar situations and addictions as 
                                they are, all without discouragement to stay sober.</p>
                                <p>Best of all, many sober living environments do not have a limit to how 
                                long residents can stay, allowing them to live there as long as they think 
                                they need to.</p>

        description: `Tips to Control Blood Sugar Level?`,
        content: `<p>If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, you should know that it will 
                have serious consequences on your health if you do not control your blood sugar. 
                There is, unfortunately, no cure so you have to ensure that you eat right, exercise 
                well, make appropriate changes to your lifestyle, and monitor your blood sugar level 
                to keep the negative impact to the minimum. Some practical tips that can keep you more 
                in control and prevent diabetes as well.</p>
                <p>Diabetes prevention: how to control blood sugar level?</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>SHED YOUR FLAB
                                <p>Losing weight is the first advice that most doctors treating 
                                diabetics will give. Being overweight results in insulin resistance 
                                and it becomes difficult for your body to maintain the right level 
                                of blood glucose.</p>
                                <p>According to experts, even reducing your weight by 10-15% can 
                                help significantly to improve your blood sugar levels. The most 
                                effective ways of losing weight are exercising, making suitable 
                                lifestyle changes, and eating right.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>UP THE LEVEL OF YOUR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
                                <p>Diabetes is most often seen in people who lead sedentary lifestyles 
                                and exercise inadequately. Regular exercise helps to burn body fat, 
                                keeps your weight down and promotes the production of insulin by your 
                                pancreas. As a result, the level of blood sugar reduces and the health 
                                of your internal organs gets a boost. You need not exercise intensively, 
                                just a 30-minute brisk walk will serve to make your system more 
                                flexible and reduce your weight. If you are a drug researcher, 
                                buy only from the best manufacturers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>ADOPT A BALANCED DIET
                                <p>The ideal diet for diabetics is one that has a good balance of proteins, 
                                carbohydrates, vitamin D and fats. You can cut out the excess calories 
                                by not eating food and drink with added sugar and carbs with a low 
                                glycemic index that are very quickly digested leaving you feeling 
                                hungry sooner. Make it a point to substitute simple carbs with complex 
                                carbs that are present in whole grains and vegetables because they 
                                deliver a more sustained release of energy.</p>
                                <p>By all means, have your quota of lean meat like fish and chicken, 
                                but try to load your plate with more fresh vegetables that not only 
                                deliver the required vitamins and micro-nutrients but also fiber 
                                that helps to reduce the urge to eat, and keeps your digestive 
                                system clean.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>TIME YOUR MEALS
                                <p>It is easier to control the level of blood sugar when you eat 
                                small meals more frequently instead of the conventional breakfast, 
                                lunch, and dinner. Studies have revealed that having 6-8 smaller 
                                meals throughout the day is better for avoiding the blood sugar 
                                spikes and dips. You should also aim to make breakfast your principal 
                                meal, while your lunch and dinner can be more modest as this is 
                                proven to be more effective in regulating blood sugar.</p>
